C.D.W. divided rate expression by 2, to get rate of addition per site.

Values (4.395E+10	1.00	0	0.45) confirmed to fit table (divided by 2) 
by rwest@mit.edu  7-Sep-2009

Agreement with experimental data from Cobos et al. 
(C. J. Cobos, H. Hippler, and J. Troe, *J. Phys. Chem.* 89, 342, 1985)
was promising **at low pressures**, but 
"Significant deviations are observed between theory and experiment as the 
high-pressure limit is approached."
    
E.g., at 298 K

    "However, the value of 
    the high-pressure limit rate coefficient at 298.15 K for the
    termolecular process computed with TST, model I, and 
    model II does not agree with the estimated high-pressure 
    limit value of Cobos et al. at that temperature. TST, 
    model I, and model II agree with one another, predicting a 
    value of Log10(k)=-10.7 where the value of the limiting 
    high-pressure rate coefficient k=2E-11 cm3/molecule/s at 298.15 K, 
    while Cobos et al. estimate a value of Log10(k)=-10.12 
    (that is, k=7.5E-11 cm3/molecule/s)"
    
The calculations used the *ab initio* PES of Walch et al., which was the best available in 1991.

Many extensions and improvements are suggested for future work, which may well 
have happened since the paper was published in 1996. Revision of this rate is recommended.

We are using a primary R. radical as a methyl radical. The rate comes from n-butyl.

[8]   Curran, H.J.; Gaffuri, P.; Pit z, W.J.; Westbrook, C.K. *Combust. Flame* 2002, 129, 253-280. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0010-2180(01)00373-X

In their study modelling iso-octane oxidation, Curran et al [8] chose to use the rate measured by Lenhardt et al [143] described below.

[143] Lenhardt, T.M.; McDade, C.E.; Bayes, K.D.; *J. Chem. Phys.* 1980, 72,304 http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.438848

Rates measurement of **n-butyl** + O2 at 300 K. High pressure limit from flash photolysis experiments.

C.D.W. divided rate expression by 2, to get rate of addition rate per site,
giving  (2.26±0.42)E12 cm3/mole/sec.

    Rate constants for the reaction of four different butyl radicals with molecular oxygen 
    have been measured **at room temperature**. The radicals were generated by flash photolysis 
    and their time decay was followed with a photoionization mass spectrometer. The radical 
    concentrations were kept low to avoid complications from radical–radical reactions. 
    Radical lifetimes were long, up to 50 msec, thus assuring that thermalized radicals were being studied. 
    
    The rate constants, in units of 10E−11 cm3/molecule/sec, are:
    
     * **n-butyl (0.75±0.14); (gives (2.26±0.42)E12 cm3/mole/sec when divided by 2 to get rate per site)**
     * s-butyl (1.66±0.22); (gives (5.00±0.66)E12 cm3/mole/sec when divided by 2 to get rate per site)
     * t-butyl (2.34±0.39); (gives (7.05±1.17)E12 cm3/mole/sec when divided by 2 to get rate per site)
     * 3-hydroxy s-butyl (2.8±1.8). (gives (8.43±5.42)E12 cm3/mole/sec when divided by 2 to get rate per site)
     
    No pressure dependence of the rate constants was observed over the range 1 to 4 Torr. 

Because radical addition to a double bond is probably barrierless, the temperature range 300-1500K
has been assigned although the rate was only measured at 300K.

Lenhardt [143] measured (10.0±1.3)E12 cm3/mole/sec (at 300K, high pressure limit, from flash photolysis experiments.)
Atkinson [96], in their review, recommend 6.62E12 cm3/mole/sec. (according to Curran [8]).
Curran [8], in their modelling paper, refer to both these and chose and "intermediate" value of 7.54E12 cm3/mol/sec.

Curran [8] is the rate adopted here, giving 3.77E+12 cm3/mole/sec when divided by two to give the rate of addition per site.
The uncertainty of 1E12 cm3/mole/sec was estimated from these values

radicals to C2H2.  Author notes that this could be used as an upper limit for
cyclopentadiene formation.

C2H2 + C2H3 --> CH2=CHCH=CH. (Rxn. -5?)

Verified by Greg Magoon: note: NIST seems to have values (http://kinetics.nist.gov/kinetics/Detail?id=1988DUR/AMO636:5 , which agree with RMG's original values) that are slightly diferent than this paper's values (p. 637); I can't seem to figure out where the NIST values are coming from (maybe Table 3?); therefore, I have changed rateLibrary to use paper parameters of 10^8.8 (/2) and 4.9 kcal/mol (these values seem to actually be taken from other publications, however), which I am assuming to be high-pressure values; also note that values from other sources are available in the NIST Kinetics Database

C2H2 + CCH --> HC(tb)CCH=CH. (Rxn. 18?) 

NIST Record: http://kinetics.nist.gov/kinetics/Detail?id=1988DUR/AMO636:4
Verified by Greg Magoon: it looks like value is taken from Rxn 18 of Table 3 (1E10), and is apparently non-pressure dependent (and non-temp dependent); based on the table, it looks like Ref. 42 in this paper may be the ultimate source of the value?

C2H2 + .OH --> HOCH=CH

pg.583-584: Discussion on evaluated data

OH+C2H2(+m) --> C2H2OH(+m): "At temperatures below ~1100K and at atmospheric pressure,

the addition channel becomes important and shows a strong pressure dependence.
The following parameters give a reasonable representation of the high temperature data
for k and are also compatible with Atkinson's analysis at low temperature ..."
RMG stores the recommended high-pressure limit rate coefficient, k_inf.

Same reaction as #332, #333 ranked as more accurate in rate library than #332, but they are both from relatively old sources from the early '90s.
