If a biradical CH2JJ can abstract from RCH4 to make RCH3J and CH3J 
then a Y_rad CH3J should be able to abstract from RCH3J which means X_H needs 
to include Xrad_H. I.e. you can abstract from a radical. To make this possible
a head node has been created X_H_or_Xrad_H which is a union of X_H and Xrad_H.
The kinetics for it have just been copied from X_H and are only defined for 
abstraction by Y_rad_birad. I.e. the top level very approximate guess.

Do better kinetics for this exist? Do we in fact use the reverse kinetics anyway?

Entry 40,21 (b): No data available at the time.  The author recommends the rate coefficient

of C2H6+C2H=C2H2+C2H5 for the rxn C3H8+C2H=C2H2+n-C3H7.  Due to the high exothermicity
of the rxn, the author assumes the H-atom abstraction rxn is limited to the number
of H-atoms available, thus recommedning a rate coefficient equal to one-third that
recommended for C3H8+C2H=C2H2+n-C3H7.

pg.22: Discussion on evaluated data

Entry 43,24(b): A study by Berces and Trotman-Dickenson reported a rate coefficient

for the rxn iC4H10+CH3O=CH3OH+C4H9 isomer.  Tsang used the rate coefficient for
the rxn CH3O+C(CH3)4=CH3OH+H2C*-C(CH3)3 determined by Shaw and Trotman-Dickenson
as a characteristic for CH3O+primary H-atom abstraction to recommend a rate coefficient
for iC4H10+CH3O=CH3OH+iC4H9.  This rate expression was subtracted from the rate
coefficient reported by Berces and Trotman-Dickenson to yield the rate coefficient
for iC4H10+CH3O=CH3OH+tC4H9.  Lastly, the pre-exponential factor was cut in half,
due to Tsang\'s correcting an arithmetic error by Kerr and Parsonage (perhaps this
work was referenced in the Berces and Trotman-Dickenson study?)

pg 233-234: Discussion on evaluated data

Verified by MRH on 6Aug2009

Entry 46,5(f): No measurements on H-atom abstraction rxns. Recommended rate coefficient

is computed as follows:

The rate of O + C3H6 --> OH + H2C=CH-*CH2 is computed using the expression:
[k(O+C2H6-->C2H5+HO)/k(OH+C2H6-->C2H5+H2O)] * k(OH+C3H6-->H2C=CH-*CH2+H2O).
The author uses this expression because he notes that OH and O H-atom abstraction
rxns generally follow the same trend.  The O+C2H6, OH+C2H6, and OH+C3H6
are from other Tsang review articles.
The rate of O+C3H6 --> OH+CH3C=CH2 is computed by adjusting the O+C3H6 --> OH+H2C=CH-*CH2
rate coefficient: increasing the Ea/R by 880 Kelvin and multiplying the A
by ~0.345; these values come from the relative difference between the rxns
OH+C3H6 --> H2O+H2C=CH-*CH2 and OH+C3H6 --> H2O+CH3C=CH2

MRH CBS-QB3 calculations w/o HR corrections
H2O2 + CH3*CHCH[OH]CH3 = 2-Butanol + HO2

CBS-QB3 method was used to calculate electronic energy of reactants, products, and TS; frequencies were
calculated using B3LYP/CBSB7 method.  Arrhenius expression was computed using CanTherm: an asymmetric Eckart
tunneling correction was employed and the frequencies were scaled by 0.99 (as suggested by Montgomery et al.
J.Chem.Phys. 110 (1999) 2822-2827).  The external symmetry number for H2O2 was 2; the external symmetry number
for the remaining species and TS were set to 1.  The rate coefficient was computed at 600-2000K (in 200 K increments).
The computed pre-exponential factor was divided by 2 and this is the reported value.
